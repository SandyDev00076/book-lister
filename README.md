Its just a book lister containing more than 10000 books. It contains the title of these books along with author names and the rating it got over the years.
It also has a cart functionality which can be used as of now. However checkout functionality hasn't been implemented yet.
I took the privilege of hosting it using the free hosting service **Netlify** .
